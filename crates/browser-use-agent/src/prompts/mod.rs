//! Base system prompt + model-facing prompt assets for the async agent engine.
//!
//! This module is the agent crate's home for the **model-visible** prompt
//! content the engine sends to the provider: the browser-agent base system
//! prompt, the browser tool descriptions, the collaboration-mode developer
//! instructions, the compacted-context system message, the helper-session
//! prompts, and the review prompt. The content itself lives in the repo-root
//! `prompts/` directory (shared with the legacy `browser-use-core` engine) and
//! is already browser-use branded; this module `include_str!`s those assets and
//! exposes them as `pub const`s plus accessor functions.
//!
//! The accessors mirror the legacy `browser-use-core::prompts` API
//! (`crates/browser-use-core/src/prompts.rs`) so the cutover from the sync
//! engine to this async engine is a drop-in swap:
//! - [`collaboration_mode_prompt`] ↔ legacy `collaboration_mode_instructions`
//! - [`compacted_context_system_message`] ↔ legacy `compacted_context_system_message`
//! - [`render_prompt_template`] ↔ legacy `render_prompt_template`
//!
//! The base system prompt ([`BASE_SYSTEM_PROMPT`] / [`system_prompt`]) mirrors
//! the legacy provider preamble assembly in
//! `crates/browser-use-providers/src/lib.rs` (it `push_str`s the trimmed
//! `browser-agent-system.md` asset).
//!
//! Branding: every model-facing const here is browser-use branded. The
//! [`tests`] module includes a de-brand guard that asserts no `codex`/`chatgpt`
//! brand string leaks into any model-facing prompt const.

Routing this case from the attempt's state is correct — the candidate fields alone can't tell you Chrome will reject the WebSocket; you only find out by trying. Do NOT infer this case from old chat history, old `browser status --json`, or a stale `last_issue`; if Chrome may have been closed/reopened or the user says no popup is visible, run `browser status --json` / `browser connect local` again and follow the latest result. The on-disk toggle is already on; Chrome is showing (or has queued) its per-session \"Allow remote debugging?\" popup and waiting on the user.
