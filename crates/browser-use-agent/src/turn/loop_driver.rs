//! Unbounded turn-loop driver — the integration spine (codex `turn.rs:214-397`).
//!
//! This is the async driver that ties the merged pieces together. It owns NO
//! control-flow heuristics of its own: every branch routes through the PURE
//! [`decision::classify_loop_step`] core (WP-A1), so the loop is exactly codex's
//! `loop {}` shape with the policy factored out and unit-tested separately.
//!
//! ## Codex parity (`turn.rs:131-400`)
//! The driver reproduces codex's per-iteration sequence verbatim:
//! 1. **read pending input** — gated by `can_drain`. `can_drain` starts as
//!    [`decision::initial_can_drain`]`(turn_has_fresh_input)` (`turn.rs:168`):
//!    fresh user input must be *sampled* first, so we hold the drain on the very
//!    first iteration when there is fresh input; otherwise we may drain
//!    immediately. After the first iteration `can_drain` is always `true` except
//!    immediately after a compaction step, where it is set per the decision's
//!    `can_drain_next` (`turn.rs:306`).
//! 2. **run sampling** — [`SamplingDriver::run_sampling_request`] (WP-B5). One
//!    model round-trip per iteration. (See "Sampling/dispatch composition" below
//!    for why the loop calls sampling directly and does not separately invoke the
//!    [`ToolDispatcher`](super::ToolDispatcher).)
//! 3. **compute the step** — `has_pending_input` is recomputed from
//!    [`TurnState::has_pending_input`], and the whole `(outcome, pending, token
//!    status)` triple is handed to [`decision::classify_loop_step`], which folds
//!    `needs_follow_up = model_needs_follow_up || has_pending_input`
//!    (`turn.rs:255`) and the `token_limit_reached && needs_follow_up`
//!    compaction trigger (`turn.rs:282`) into a single [`decision::LoopStep`].
//! 4. **act on the step**:
//!    - [`LoopStep::CompactThenContinue`](decision::LoopStep::CompactThenContinue)
//!      → run the compaction hook, set `can_drain` to the decision's
//!      `can_drain_next`, and continue (`turn.rs:282-310`).
//!    - [`LoopStep::Continue`](decision::LoopStep::Continue) → set `can_drain =
//!      true` and continue (`turn.rs:250-255`).
//!    - [`LoopStep::Complete`](decision::LoopStep::Complete) → record the last
//!      agent message and break (`turn.rs:340-355`).
//!
//! On a [`AgentError::TurnAborted`](crate::AgentError::TurnAborted) from sampling
//! the loop breaks and returns the message accumulated so far (codex reports the
//! abort via a `TurnAborted` event and returns the interrupted result rather than
//! propagating a hard error; `turn.rs:357`). Any other error propagates.
//!
//! ## No max-turns counter (UNBOUNDED)
//! Codex's turn loop is an unbounded `loop {}` (`turn.rs:214`); there is no
//! iteration cap. We deliberately keep it unbounded — the only termination
//! conditions are `Complete`, cancellation, or a hard error. The loop tests prove
//! a 50-iteration scripted run completes without hitting any cap.
//!
//! ## Sampling/dispatch composition (read B5 + C1)
//! `turn/sampling.rs` ([`SamplingDriver`]) and `turn/dispatch.rs`
//! ([`ToolDispatcher`](super::ToolDispatcher)) are SEPARATE seams. The frozen
//! [`SamplingDriver::run_sampling_request`] returns a
//! [`decision::SamplingOutcome`] whose `model_needs_follow_up` is `true` iff the
//! model emitted ≥1 tool call; it does **not** itself run the tool calls. The
//! design (DESIGN.md "SamplingDriver vs ToolDispatcher boundary") notes codex
//! FUSES the model stream and tool dispatch inside one
//! `try_run_sampling_request`, while this rearchitecture SPLITS them. The frozen
//! `TurnLoop::new(state, sampler, observer)` takes NO dispatcher, and the
//! `SamplingDriver` trait surfaces no tool calls/messages to the loop — so the
//! loop drives **sampling only** and treats `model_needs_follow_up` as the signal
//! that another round-trip is needed. A production `SamplingDriver` therefore owns
//! the fused sampling+dispatch step internally (running the `ToolDispatcher`,
//! recording outputs into the shared [`TurnState`] / `ContextManager`, and
//! reporting follow-up via the outcome). This keeps the loop a thin, pure-policy
//! spine over the frozen traits and the `decision::` core, exactly the shapes
//! WP-C2 owns. If the split ever diverges from codex's drain timing, the design
//! note's escape hatch is to fuse the two traits — the loop control flow here is
//! unaffected.
//!
//! ## Compaction (stubbed body, codex-faithful control flow)
//! The real model-based compaction work package is not built yet. On a
//! `CompactThenContinue` step the loop calls [`TurnState::compact`] — a hook with
//! a default no-op body the tests override — and then sets `can_drain` from the
//! decision's `can_drain_next` (`= !model_needs_follow_up`, `turn.rs:306`). The
//! **control flow** is codex-faithful (compact, set drain, continue); only the
//! compaction body is a stub. When the compaction WP lands it fills
//! `TurnState::compact` (and the production `SamplingDriver` re-runs against the
//! compacted history) with no change to this driver.
