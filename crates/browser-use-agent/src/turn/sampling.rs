//! Sampling driver implementation (stream + retry + transport fallback).
//!
//! The concrete [`ModelSamplingDriver`] is the default [`SamplingDriver`]
//! (`turn/mod.rs`) impl over `browser_use_llm::route::ModelClient`. Per turn it:
//!
//! 1. builds an [`LlmRequest`] from the input `Vec<Message>` + a `Route`,
//! 2. calls `ModelClient::stream(route, req)` to obtain an event stream,
//! 3. consumes that stream under a [`CancellationToken`] (via `tokio::select!`
//!    on `cancel.cancelled()` — on cancel it stops and returns
//!    [`AgentError::TurnAborted`]),
//! 4. maps each [`LlmEvent`] to UI events via [`events::map_llm_event`] and emits
//!    them through an injected [`EventSink`],
//! 5. accumulates the assistant message text, tool calls, and [`Usage`], and
//! 6. returns a [`decision::SamplingOutcome`] whose `model_needs_follow_up` is
//!    `true` iff the response carried >=1 tool call.
//!
//! The network send is wrapped in a retry loop that delegates *all* branching to
//! the merged pure core ([`decision::retry_decision`] + [`decision::backoff_ms`]).
//! On a retryable error it sleeps `backoff_ms` then retries up to
//! `stream_max_retries`; on `RetryAction::Fail` it returns the error.
//!
//! ## Codex parity (`codex-rs/core/src/session/turn.rs::run_sampling_request`)
//! - retry budget = `provider.stream_max_retries()` (here `AgentConfig::stream_max_retries`);
//! - `ContextWindowExceeded` / `UsageLimitReached` short-circuit to the matching
//!   [`AgentError`] variant *before* the retry branch (they are never retried);
//! - `model_needs_follow_up = !tool_calls.is_empty()`;
//! - `last_agent_message = (!full_text.is_empty()).then_some(full_text)`;
//! - cancellation mid-stream -> `TurnAborted`;
//! - codex gates retries on the *pre-increment* counter (`if retries < max_retries`),
//!   so `max_retries == N` allows the initial attempt + N retries (N+1 opens). We
//!   pass the pre-increment `attempt` to `decision::retry_decision` to match;
//! - codex computes its delay as `backoff(retries)` *after* `retries += 1`, so the
//!   first retry waits `backoff(1)`. The pure `backoff_ms` is 0-indexed, so we feed
//!   the post-increment `backoff_ms(attempt + 1)` to the decision as the requested
//!   delay — the realized sleep matches codex exactly while the pure budget gate
//!   stays untouched (see `handle_stream_error`).
//!
//! ## Transport switch
//! `RetryAction::SwitchTransport` (codex's WS fallback) is **not yet wired** — the
//! WS transport does not exist in `browser-use-llm` yet. We therefore report
//! `can_switch_transport = false` to the pure decision, which folds the
//! at-max-with-no-transport case straight into `RetryAction::Fail`. When the WS
//! transport lands, set `can_switch_transport` from the live client and handle the
//! returned `SwitchTransport` action here. (TODO: WP that wires WS fallback.)
//!
//! ## Jitter (I/O-layer only)
//! `decision::backoff_ms` is intentionally deterministic so the pure decision stays
//! testable. To match codex's real-world jitter we multiply the *already-decided*
//! delay by a random `0.9..=1.1` factor **here**, strictly behind the actual
//! `tokio::time::sleep`. This never feeds back into the pure decision, so parity of
//! the decision core is preserved. Tests disable jitter (it only affects sleep wall
//! time, never control flow or the returned outcome).
