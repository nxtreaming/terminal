//! Credential helpers for on-disk login state.
//!
//! ## Codex (chatgpt.com) login support
//! Holds the Codex (`~/.codex/auth.json`) reader + route builder: a user who has
//! logged in with the Codex CLI (or imported those credentials) can run the
//! engine against the ChatGPT-backed backend (`chatgpt.com/backend-api`). This is
//! a supported production code path, part of the default build.
//!
//! The other production path resolves credentials from standard provider env keys
//! (`OPENAI_API_KEY` / `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `LLM_BROWSER_*` / etc.) and builds an
//! [`crate::route::Route`] via the first-party [`crate::providers`] facades
//! (`OpenAi`, `Anthropic`, `OpenAiCompatible`). See
//! `browser-use-agent::turn::model_path`.
