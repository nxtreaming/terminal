# STATUS — verified state & how we continue (replan after the swarm incident)

_Last updated: 2026-05-30. Single source of truth for what is DONE vs NOT._

## Trust rule
Only commits **made and test-verified in the working session** are trusted. A separate
agent ran on similarly-named branches (`sanfrancisco-*`) and the branch namespace got
tangled. **Do not merge, rebase, or delete anything under `sanfrancisco-*` or any ref whose
provenance is unconfirmed.** Verify with `cargo test` (with a `timeout`) before trusting.

## What got fucked (post-mortem)
1. **Parallel git mutations raced** (cherry-pick + worktree-remove at once) → orphaned commits onto stray branches.
2. **A real bug × no isolation:** `scrub()` infinite loop hung ~16 test binaries; every parallel agent re-ran the full suite → load avg 21, "stuck terminals". **Fixed in `8481788`.**
3. **Worktrees branched from wrong bases / random names** (`sanfrancisco-*`), partly from a different agent.
4. **Wrong framing:** "loop until the whole rewrite is done" swarmed a mostly-**serial**, months-scale job. That was the core mistake.

## DONE & verified (on `decodex`, this session)
- **`browser-use-llm` crate — green, 74 tests** (`cargo test -p browser-use-llm`, runs in <1s):
  - `schema/` typed canonical model (request/message/content-parts/events+lifecycle/usage/options/errors)
  - `route/` traits (Protocol/ProtocolStream/Endpoint/Auth) + **async ModelClient/executor** (retry/backoff, rate-limit parse, secret redaction)
  - `protocols/` 3 wire protocols: OpenAI Responses, OpenAI Chat (ollama/openrouter/deepseek/fireworks), Anthropic Messages — each with fixture decode tests
  - `protocols/utils/` Lifecycle + ToolStream + SSE framing
  - **scrub() infinite-loop bug fixed** (`8481788`)
- **Phase 0.1 carve (partial):** ~16 cohesive modules extracted from `browser-use-core/src/lib.rs` (47.3k→44.3k lines); core suite was 488 green at extraction. Plateaued at the tangled core (needs the async rework).

## RECOVERABLE but NOT yet integrated (mine; behind backup refs)
- `backup/wp17-facades-43187b2` — provider facades (OpenAi/Anthropic/OpenAiCompatible) + its own scrub fix. **Conflicts with our scrub fix** — take only the `providers/` files.
- `backup/wp18-toolruntime-3c9b850` — define-once `Tool` + `tool_runtime` loop (committed on stray branch `sanfrancisco-llm-toolrt`).
- `backup/decodex-pre-reset-5352056` — the full pre-fix tip.
- `/tmp/backup-rearchitecture-notes/` — parity design notes (useful research from the agent fan-out).

## DO NOT TOUCH
- `sanfrancisco-ledger-validation`, `sanfrancisco-llm-toolrt` (branches + worktrees) — other agent / orphaned.
- `origin/decodex` is pinned at `046a80a` (planning checkpoint). Local `decodex` is ahead with verified work; **push only when a milestone is fully green and you say so.**

## How we continue (milestone-based, NO swarm)
**Hard process rules now:**
- One WP at a time. Sequential git ops only — never parallel mutations.
- Every test run wrapped in `timeout` (e.g. `timeout 300 cargo test ...`) so a hang can't pin the machine.
- Worktrees (only when files are genuinely disjoint) named `decodex-<feature>` from the current tip; removed after merge.
- Fix bugs before any fan-out. Verify before trusting any pre-existing commit.

**Milestone 1 — finish & land the LLM crate (low-risk, next):**
1. [x] Restore verified baseline + fix scrub() (`8481788`)
2. [x] Integrate WP 1.7 facades (`providers/` files only; 89 crate tests green; `7f63ef2`)
3. [x] Integrate WP 1.8 tool_runtime (`tool.rs` + `tool_runtime.rs`; 102 crate tests green; `2ef9e29`)
4. [x] `timeout 300 cargo test -p browser-use-llm` green → **MILESTONE 1 DONE** (102 tests, <1s, no hang)

**Milestone 2 — finish the carve** — ✅ **DONE at its working boundary.**
- ~16 cohesive modules extracted; `lib.rs` 47.3k → 44.3k; `browser-use-core` 488 tests green at `ecfd2bf`.
- A further pass found ~4 more async-free extractable clusters (`response_items`, `model_catalog_remote`,
  `task_analytics`, `image_artifacts`) BUT could not land them due to **branch contention** (two
  committers on `decodex` raced — the loop driver + the carve sub-agent), so it reset to the green
  baseline `ecfd2bf`. **Root-cause fix going forward:** never run a sub-agent that commits to `decodex`
  while the loop also commits to `decodex`. Sub-agents commit on their OWN branch/worktree only.
- Those 4 clusters are deferred — they'll fall out naturally during the **B: parallel rewrite** below,
  so we are NOT going to keep poking the monolith on `decodex`.
- The async-bound residue (context, compact, session, events, agents_md, hooks, skills, plugins,
  subagents, the turn loop, providers_glue) is M3 work.

**Milestone 3 — the async engine — STRATEGY CHOSEN: (B) PARALLEL REWRITE.**
Build a NEW async engine crate (`browser-use-agent`, working name) alongside the existing sync
`browser-use-core`, on top of the frozen async `browser-use-llm`. Port subsystem-by-subsystem with
codex-parity tests; cut over (TUI/CLI switch from core → agent) only at the end. **Why B fits now:** a
new crate = brand-new files = ZERO contention with the monolith — which is exactly the failure mode that
kept biting us. Sub-agents can even work disjoint *new* files safely.
M3 sub-plan (each its own WP, verified+committed before the next; the FIRST few are isolated new files,
so they're loop-safe; later cutover steps are human-gated):
- 3.1 scaffold `browser-use-agent` crate (deps: tokio, browser-use-llm, browser-use-protocol, browser-use-store) — compiles empty, 0 tests.
- 3.2 async turn loop (codex parity: unbounded loop on needs_follow_up, CancellationToken, FuturesOrdered) — pure logic + scripted-source tests, no real I/O.
- 3.3 context manager with REAL token accounting (per-provider `Usage` from browser-use-llm).
- 3.4 ToolOrchestrator/ToolRuntime/Approvable/Sandboxable seam (sandbox=None stub) — additive new files.
- 3.5 session/resume over SQLite as a write-sink + event-notify.
- 3.6+ port tools, then subsystems, then safety (Phases 3–6 of IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN), each on the new crate.
- FINAL (human-gated): switch TUI/CLI to the new engine; retire `browser-use-core`.

See `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` for the full WP list and `REARCHITECTURE.md` for the design.
